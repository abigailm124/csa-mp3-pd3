# 2024 Question 4

## This question is about 
- 2D ArrayList
- comparing neighbors in a 2D list
- checking is one is greater than the other
- index out of bounds errors
- creating a sum
- while loop

## Struggles with this question
At this point of the test, the very last question, after 3 hours, my brain was absolutely fried. So, when I stumbled upon part B, it took me a few minutes to realize what type of loop I had to use. While (no pun intended) the answer was quite obvious thinking about it now, it took some time to click in my head. However, once I finally decided the while loop was the right move, I was able to easily complete the question. 


## Prior experiences that helped 
A prior experience that helped me with this question was the mock exam. In my opinion, question four of the mock exam was way harder than the one on the actual exam. So, after I went through that traumatic question, this question wasn't so bad. I was bracing myself for a much more difficult question, especially since the other 3 weren't too bad. 

## What I learned by doing this question 
I learned that in a while loop, you have to be careful when using || because it can lead to an infinite while loop. I realized this when I coded it out on replit and it never finished running.
