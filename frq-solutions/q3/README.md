# 2024 Question 3

## This question is about 
- substrings
- using indexOf
- checking if the String before is in the String.
- making a new ArrayList

## Struggles with this question
This question was generally pretty simple, but as I was reading the question, I was wondering what String method would be the best to use. However, once I was done reading the full thing, I knew right away that indexOf was the one I would use. 

## Prior experiences that helped 
In the beginning of the year, we had a lot of practice with String methods to get the ball rolling. All of this practice, along with the JQR, was really useful for this question. 

## What I learned by doing this question 
I learned that we could've used a simplier way of checking if a String is contained in another String just by using .contains, which I found on tiktok later that day. I wasn't farmilar with this method, however, I learned that this would've been more efficient. Regardless, .contains is not part of our curriculum or the JQR so I probably would've just used indexOf anyway.
