# 2024 Question 3

## This question is about 
- substrings
- using indexOf
- checking if the String before is in the String.
- making a new ArrayList

## Struggles with this question
One thing I struggled with was wondering what String method I should use .indexOf? .equals? 

## Prior experiences that helped 
All of the String questions we did for practice in class helped and also the JQR.

## What I learned by doing this question 
I learned that we could've used .contains, which I found on tiktok later that day. I wasn't farmilar with this,
however, I learned that this would've been more efficient.
