# 2024 Question 1

## This question is about 
- Math.random()
- 95% chance
- simulating a probability
- updating instance variables

## Struggles with this question
College Board thought they were slick by casually throwing a bear in the question. It came out of nowhere and threw me off for a few minutes. I kept rereading the prompt to figure out where this bear is coming from. However, after a few moments of confusion I finally realized that we have to generate our own percentage to determine if the bear appears or not. So, while this was not a huge struggle, it did worry me in the beginning. 

## Prior experiences that helped 
One thing that helped with this question was reviewing the Math.random right before the test. When we came to class early that day, the formula was on the board and then we quickly talked about it. Even though I did mess it up on the test a little bit, knowing we just reviewed it gave me the confidence boost that I needed to continue with motivation. 

## What I learned by doing this question 
I learned that adding +1 to the formula is essential in the formula, but I forgot it on the test :(. This keeps me up at night, but, life goes on (or so they say).
