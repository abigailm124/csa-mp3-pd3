# 2024 Question 1

## This question is about 
- Math.random
- 95% chance
- simulating a probability
- updating instance variables

## Struggles with this question
I sturggled for a moment on the test when I was confused where the bear came from.
However, I then realized that we needed two math.radndoms. 

## Prior experiences that helped 
One thing that helped with this question was reviewing the Math.random before the test.
This was a huge refresher and when I got to this question I almost remembered the whole formula.

## What I learned by doing this question 
I learned that adding +1 to the formula is essential in the formula, but I forgot it on the test :(
